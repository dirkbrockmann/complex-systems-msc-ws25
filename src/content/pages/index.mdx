... to the website of the module **Introduction to Complex Systems** 
for the winter term 2025/26 (M0500-31W20). 
Below is a brief overview of the topics covered 
in this course. The course is part of the 
[Bachelor Degree program Molecular Biology and Biotechnology](https://tu-dresden.de/studium/vor-dem-studium/studienangebot/sins/sins_studiengang?autoid=313)
and is offered as an elective compulsory module.

A summary of the key parameters of the course 
(structure, schedule, location, etc.) is provided
in the [TL;DR](/tldr) section.

## What is this course about?

<Figure src={complexity} srcDark={complexityDark} alt="Complexity.">
**Complexity:** A science like a fungus, connecting all sorts of traditional
fields, breaching boundaries, crossing lines and connecting phenomena
</Figure>

<Figure src={rollingDie} srcDark={rollingDieDark} alt="a rolling die" margin={true}>
**A rolling die:** A complex system.

This course offers an overview and basic understanding of 
complex dynamic phenomena in biological, physical and social systems.
The focus is on biological systems but with a particular emphasis on how phenomena
observed in biological systems are related to systems outside of biology. 
**For example:** Are the dynamic patterns observed in flocking birds and schooling
fish related to pedestrian dynamics, or politica polarization? What are
the underlying principles?

Complexity science is about unraveling these underlying principles that 
drive a complex phenomenon 
and trying to construct models based on these underlying principles that
can reproduce the basic properties of a system with as few ingredients as possible. 
Complex systems come in different flavors and can be associated with different 
fundamental 
phenomena and concepts each of which will be covered in the course.

AI is about predicting things we don't understand. Complexity is about
understanding things we can't predict.

<Figure src={metronomes} srcDark={metronomesDark} margin={true} alt="metronomes on a board">
**How to synchronize:** All you need are five metronomes, a board and two empty cans.
</Figure>
Most of these concepts and phenomena occur and are applied across a broad range of fields. 
Here's a list of those that will be covered in the course:

- [Chaotic Dynamics](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/chaotic-dynamics/)
- [Synchronization](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/synchronization/)
- [Pattern Formation](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/pattern-formation/)
- [Critical Phenomena & Tipping Points](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/critical-phenomena/)
- [Growth Processes](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/growth-processes/)
- [Collective Behavior](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/collective-behavior/)
- [Complex Networks](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/complex-networks/)
- [Fractals & Self-Similarity](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/self-similarity/)
- [Cooperative Systems](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/cooperation/)

## Complexity Explorables

<Figure src={network} srcDark={networkDark} alt="Network" margin={true}>
**Complex Networks:** A topic discussed in this course.
</Figure>
When you click on a topic above, you'll be directed to a 
collection of [Complexity Explorables](www.complexity-explorables.org) 
that illustrates one of more of the topics.

A while back I launched the [**Complexity Explorables** website](https://www.complexity-explorables.org) 
in order to illustrate intuitively some of the more or 
less famous models of complex systems science. The models exhibit complex 
behavior and help explaining complex systems observed in natural and social systems. 
The Complexity Explorables will play a prominent role in the course. 

Take a quit break and [explore some here](https://www.complexity-explorables.org).

## Structure of the Course

The course has three components:

- **Lecture:** Theoretical foundations, seminal models and key concepts.
- **Seminar:** Presentation and discussion of selected Complexity Explorables.
- **Lab session:** Implementation of computer simulations of models of complex systems.

### The lectures

The lectures will capture the topics listed above. 

### The Seminar

The seminar is designed for students to focus more deeply and individually on a 
specific research project from the range of topics discussed in the lecture. 
Each student will pick a **Complexity Explorable** and study the system it 
describes and related papers in more detail. 

<Figure src={tippingpoint} srcDark={tippingpointDark} alt="tipping point." margin={true}>
**Tipping points:** Irreversible processes occur frequently in complex systems.
</Figure>
Each student will have to give a presentation on the explorable. 
The presentations will be collected on the [Seminar page](/seminar).

**Explorables are picked on a first come first serve basis.**

### The Lab Course

Computer simulations are a central analysis tool for understanding complex 
dynamic phenomena in biology. In the [lab course](/lab) 
the students will learn how to model complex systems 
with [netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), a free programming 
environment for agent based simulations. Netlogo is easy to 
learn also useful for students who have never been exposed to computer programming. 

Don't worry, you are going to have a blast.


<Figure src={sandpile} srcDark={sandpileDark} alt="Sandpile" margin={true}>
**A growing sandpile:** An example of self-organized criticality.
</Figure>
The lecture will also cover a number of basic theoretical modeling methods, analysis tools 
and techniques that are required to understand and appreciate the richness and beauty of complex systems.

## The Tutorials

On this site you will find a number of interactivetutorials that cover 
topics that are 
useful to understanding some models
and phenomena discussed in the course. Mostly these tutorials explain 
some basic mathematical concepts and methods that are used in the course. 
They are provided for those of you who are not familiar with the concepts or 
need a refresher. 
You can find the tutorials in the [tutorials section](/tutorials). 

## Language

The course language is **English**. This means the lectures will be given in English 
and the students given there seminar talk in English, too.
 

## Requirements

<Figure src={swarm} srcDark={swarmDark} alt="A swarm." margin={true}>
**Collective Behavior:** How do birds flock? We will discuss it in this course.
</Figure>

The basic requirements for the successful completion of the 
course is a basic knowledge of calculus and very basic knowledge of 
differential equations. Programming skills are not required but helpful.

If you are uncertain whether you meet the requirements, [contact me](/contact).

Every student requires a laptop computer.
