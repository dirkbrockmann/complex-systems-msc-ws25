## Hi!

This is the seminar section. Here's a bit of information you need. 

Every student participating in the seminar is required to...

1. **Pick** a [Complexity Exporable](wwww.complexity-explorables.org)
2. **Prepare** a presentation for it
3. **Give** a presentation on the explorable, and the system it is based on.

### Presentations

Should be 30 minutes in total, 20 minutes for the presentation 
and 10 minutes for discussion and interaction with the class.

If you are uncertain how to prepare a presentation or give it, 
if you feel unconformable, or struggle understanding the explorable you chose, 
feel free to [contact](/contact) me. We can set up a meeting.
