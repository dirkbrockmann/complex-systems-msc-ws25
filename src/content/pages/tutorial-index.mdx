Below is an unstructured collection of tutorials on different topics all of which are loosly and indirectly connected to the topics covered in the course. Some are helpful for understanding some models better, others cover some mathematical concepts. All tutorials are rather short and do not go in depth. 

These tutorials contain **interactive illustrations** and **explorables** to develop an intuition about concepts. 

The list is **not ordered** so feel free to study the tutorials in any sequence you like.
