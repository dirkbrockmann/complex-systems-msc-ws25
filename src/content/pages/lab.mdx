## Hi!

This is the lab course section. Here's a bit of information you need. 

The lab course is a two week block course that is designed to teach you
how to model complex systems using computer simulations. 

**Don't worry:** Programming skill are not required.

We will be using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) in the course.

Netlogo is an agent based computer simulation framework that is easy to grasp and
very intuitive to use.

### Preparation

- please **bring a laptop**
- We will be using [netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) in the course. It would be good **if you installed netlogo** on your laptop before the course begins. netlogo is free.
- bring something **to drink**
- power outlets are sparse in the room, so if you want to help yourself and others **bring Verteilungssteckerleisten**.
