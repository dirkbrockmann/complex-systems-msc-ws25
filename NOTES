## What is this course about?

**Complexity:** A science like a fungus, connecting all sorts of traditional
fields, breaching boundaries, crossing lines and connecting phenomena

This course is about understanding complex dynamic phenomena in biological, physical and social systems.
The focus is on biological systems but with a particular emphasis on how phenomena
observed in biological systems are related to systems outside of biology. 
For example: Are the dynamic patterns observed in flocking birds and schooling
fish related to pedestrian dynamics, or politica polarization? What are
the underlying principles?

Complexity science is about unraveling these underlying principles that drive a complex phenomenon 
and trying to construct models based on these underlying principles that
can reproduce the basic properties of a system with as few ingredients as possible. 
Complex systems come in different flavors and can be associated with different fundamental 
phenomena and concepts each of which will be covered in the course.

AI is about predicting things we don't understand. Complexity is about
understanding things we can't predict.

**How to synchronize:** All you need are five metronomes, a board and two empty cans.
</MarginFigure>
Most of these concepts and phenomena occur and are applied across a broad range of fields. 
Here's a list of those that will be covered in the course:

- [Chaotic Dynamics](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/chaotic-dynamics/)
- [Synchronization](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/synchronization/)
- [Pattern Formation](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/pattern-formation/)
- [Critical Phenomena & Tipping Points](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/critical-phenomena/)
- [Growth Processes](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/growth-processes/)
- [Collective Behavior](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/collective-behavior/)
- [Complex Networks](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/complex-networks/)
- [Fractals & Self-Similarity](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/self-similarity/)
- [Cooperative Systems](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/topics/cooperation/)

## Complexity Explorables

<MarginFigure src={network} srcDark={networkDark} alt="Network">
**Complex Networks:** A topic discussed in this course.
</MarginFigure>
When you click on a topic above, you'll be directed to a 
collection of [Complexity Explorables](www.complexity-explorables.org) 
that illustrates one of more of the topics.

A while back I launched the [**Complexity Explorables** website](https://www.complexity-explorables.org) 
in order to illustrate intuitively some of the more or 
less famous models of complex systems science. The models exhibit complex 
behavior and help explaining complex systems observed in natural and social systems. 
The Complexity Explorables will play a prominent role in the course. 

Take a quit break and [explore some here](https://www.complexity-explorables.org).

In the seminar, every student will give a presentation on one of the explorables.

The lecture will also cover a number of basic theoretical modeling methods, analysis tools 
and techniques that are required to understand and appreciate the richness and beauty of complex systems.

## Language

The course language is **English**. This means the lectures will be given in English 
and the students given there seminar talk in English, too.
 
## The Seminar

The seminar is designed for students to focus more deeply and individually on a 
specific research project from the range of topics discussed in the lecture. 
Each student will pick a **Complexity Explorable** and study the system it 
describes and related papers in more detail. 

<MarginFigure src={tippingpoint} srcDark={tippingpointDark} alt="tipping point.">
**Tipping points:** Irreversible processes occur frequently in complex systems.
</MarginFigure>
Each student will have to give a presentation on the explorable. 
The presentations will be collected on the [Seminar page](/seminar).

**Explorables are picked on a first come first serve basis.**

## The Lab Course

Computer simulations are a central analysis tool for understanding complex 
dynamic phenomena in biology. In the [lab course](/lab) 
the students will learn how to model complex systems 
with [netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), a free programming 
environment for agent based simulations. Netlogo is easy to 
learn also useful for students who have never been exposed to computer programming. 

Don't worry, you are going to have a blast.

## Requirements

<MarginFigure src={swarm} srcDark={swarmDark} alt="A swarm.">
**Collective Behavior:** How do birds flock? We will discuss it in this course.
</MarginFigure>
The basic requirements for the successful completion of the 
course is a basic knowledge of calculus and very basic knowledge of 
differential equations. Programming skills are not required but helpful.

If you are uncertain whether you meet the requirements, [contact me](/contact).

Every student requires a laptop computer.
