Here's some information about your instructor, in case you need to get in touch and keep being updated about the course.

## Emails

I've set up an email address specifically for communication about this course. The best way to reach me (and get a response) is by using this email:

[complex-systems-bsc-ws25@tu-dresden.de](mailto:complex-systems-bsc-ws25@tu-dresden.de)

If you need to get in touch with me concerning other matters, contact my assistant **Franziska Schäfer** at
SynoSys (Center Synergy of Systems):

[synosys@tu-dresden.de](mailto:synosys@tu-dresden.de)


## Signal Group

The most efficient way to communicate in matters concerning the course
is the **signal group** that we set up every year. I advise everyone
to sign up for it.
